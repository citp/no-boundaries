<p>This demo page includes a 3rd party script (fb_steal.js) that tries to access the FB API.
Normally the 3rd party script shouldn't call the FB.api function since the FB SDK is not included or initilized.
So we can if we can spoof the FB SDK well enough to convince the script to call FB.api function.</p>
